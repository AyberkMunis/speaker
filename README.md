# Venueify
Venueify is a website that tackles three main issues which occur in public spaces (concerts, parties, stadiums, etc.): lack of customization, 
no sense of belonging to a venue, and no areas to grow for new talents. It provides a solution to all of the listed issues through creating an ever changing playlist customized by ,
listeners in public spaces which is 10% made up of new talents’ songs.  Venueify uses a three-step algorithm. First, participants scan the QR code provided at the venue to join the Venueify through their Spotify account.
Venueify will then make a similarity check between the customers’ 
music taste and pre-existing playlist at the venue. In the final step, Venueify will add the most similar song to the pre-existing playlist at the venue.
